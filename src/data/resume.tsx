  summary:
    "After my time in the Army and working in security, I taught myself to code and discovered I love building websites. Now I make clean, fast sites with Nuxt.js that load quickly and don't break. My background in security means I build stuff that keeps your data safe too. No fancy jargon â€” I just create sites that work well and help your business reach more people.",
